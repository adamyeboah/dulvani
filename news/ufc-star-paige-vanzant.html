                UFC star Paige VanZant reveals she made more money flaunting her 
                body on OnlyFans in 24 HOURS than she did 'in her entire 
                fighting career'
            </h1>
            <p class="blog_text">
                UFC star Paige VanZant has revealed she made more money in 24 hours by boasting her figure on OnlyFans than she did in her entire fighting career. 
<br /><br />
The 29-year-old blonde bombshell - who spent six years in the world of MMA before being released in 2020 - made the switch to sharing raunchy snaps of herself shortly after her UFC career and now charges fans $9.99 per month for a peak at her revealing photos. 
<br /><br />
Paige has become well-known in the racy industry and has even proclaimed herself the 'queen of OnlyFans,' adding that she doesn't see herself walking away from the online site due to the large amount of money she makes. 
<br /><br />
Speaking to Barstool Sports' Glenny Balls on his podcast titled, 'Only Stans,' Paige revealed that she has earned a 'life-changing' amount of money by posting snaps of herself that leave little to the imagination. 
                <br /><br />
She explained that it was a struggle for her to make the switch over to OnlyFans due to the stigma associated with it. 
<br /><br />
However, she noted that after she saw how much money she was earning, she didn't pay any mind to what people said. 
<br /><br />
She said: 'OnlyFans has definitely been my largest source of income. I would say combined, in my fighting career. 
<br /><br />
'I think I made more money in 24 hours on OnlyFans than I had in my entire fighting career. Combined. Yeah.' 
<br /><br />
The fighter added: 'I would say when I made the switch to — there’s a lot of stuff I’ve done in my career. I’ve been really fortunate in my career.
<br /><br />
'Even outside of the UFC and out of fighting has been pretty successful. I’ve worked pretty hard in other industries and trying to cross over, I guess [to] a more mainstream personality.' 
<br /><br />
She also spoke about how she got into the OnlyFans world and decided to share sexy content. 
<br /><br />
Paige noted that she had noticed her fan base was made of mostly men since she came from a combat sport. 
<br /><br />
 She revealed that social media was a huge factor for her making the switch because people on the web always requested she post snaps of her toned figure. 
<br /><br />
She explained: 'I have a very very large male fan base especially coming from a combat sport.' 
<br /><br />
The 29-year-old noted that she began by starting her own website where she shared 'PG' content to 'test it out.' 
<br /><br />
'I did extremely well. It was life-changing money. I did that for about two years,' she said before noting that the sum she made from her site persuaded her to move to OnlyFans.
<br /><br />
She added: 'Now, I have made the transition of if people don’t want to hire me because I have an only fans I don’t really care.'
<br /><br />
                When the UFC star first joined OnlyFans, she was afraid to push herself to share saucy snaps. 
<br /><br />
'My content started very PG, I was doing everything like Instagram, plus a little bit extra,' she explained. 
<br /><br />
However, as time went by, the sports icon noted that she put out more X-rated content and now even invites her husband to join with her.
<br /><br />
She also tries her hardest to collab with other athletes, like Mandy Saccs, who was also a member of WWE. 
<br /><br />
'As far as OnlyFans girls, I am kind of in a different lane coming from a combat sport, there is not a ton of us,' Paige added.
<br /><br />
                Paige noted that her family is 'supportive' of her boasting her physique online before diving into the oddest request she has ever received from her subscribers. 
<br /><br />
She noted that followers have often requested snaps of her armpits or her dirty feet. 
<br /><br />
Paige noted that while she has sold a kiss card for $13,000 in the past, she doesn't ever see herself selling any of items. 
<br /><br />
However, she said if someone offered her $500,000 for a pair of used panties, she would sell them.
